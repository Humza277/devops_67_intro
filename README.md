Q1 : Why should we use DevOps:
    
    DevOps describes a culture and set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to complete software development. 
    It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches. 
    And, it’s gaining popularity at a rapid rate.
    
    
    
Q2 : Challenges of DevOps 
    
    Overcoming the Dev versus Ops mentality
    The DevOps practice is all about integrating teams together and breaking down silos within IT organisations. 
    There is the old DevOps cliché of developers tossing code over an imaginary wall to operations and difference in priorities. 
    Devs trying to innovate and make changes as quickly as possible and operations trying to maintain 100% service levels. 
    The truth is the goals of both teams seem to often counter each other. They need to align the goals and priorities of the teams. 
    Also handovers between different teams are costly, expensive and a source of delay. Integrating different teams is at the heart of DevOps, and is the first hurdle that any company needs to overcome as it adopts DevOps practices.
    
    Moving from legacy infrastructure to microservices
    Older infrastructure and applications can be problematic, even if it has served the company for years. 
    Remaining on legacy infrastructure can spell stability problems, lack of support and the fact that you will be left behind the swiftly advancing competition. 
    Using Infrastructure-as-code together with microservices is yet another step towards a future of continuous innovation. 
    It modifies the development lifecycle to quickly adapt to changing markets and customer needs. If a company does not stay innovative, it will be replaced quickly by one that offers something more, no matter how popular that company has been. Replacing or modifying older, monolithic apps with newer microservices architecture can open up the floodgates to faster development and quicker innovation.
    
    Breaking of the Deep-Rooted, Cultural Habits
    DevOps is not a team. 
    It is a culture of collaboration that yields a set of best practices and operational cultures. 
    Sometimes companies wanting to adopt a DevOps approach are met with resistance from employees uncomfortable with change. 
    Leadership needs to come from the top. Executives must support employees in dismantling the status quo and breaking down silos hindering successful implementation. 
    Motivation rises when results are positive, concrete and observable. There is no magic formula but, if you get the right leadership and culture in place, chances are DevOps will land with resonance. 
    Gartner reports 88% of businesses believe team culture is one of the top impacts on an organization’s ability to scale DevOps.
    
Q3 : How DevOps benefits the business 
    
    Shorter Development Cycles, Faster Innovation 
    When we have a biased response from the development and operations teams, it is often difficult to tell if the application is operational. 
    When development teams simply submit a request, the cycle times are unnecessarily extended.
    With joint development and operations efforts, the team's applications are ready to use more quickly. 
    This is important because companies succeed on the basis of their ability to innovate faster than their competitors.
    
    A Better Environment for Technical Scalability
    Scalability is one of the top priorities for any kind of the project. 
    If the product is able to take a load and get on with it     — it is a sign that it works well. 
    If not — you know what it means. With the rise of cloud computing, it became a big deal.
    DevOps implements certain practices to secure better scalability. 
    In essence, scalability is not just what server and network are able to carry on     — it is also the tools that make it happen.
    It is important to configure the system in a flexible manner so that when necessary it will be able to increase the resource consumption and also scale it down when the load is lesser.
    The thing with these tools is that they need continuous optimization — changes in server, bandwidth and storage capacity.
